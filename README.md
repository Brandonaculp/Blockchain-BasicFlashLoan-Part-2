# Aave-Simple-Flash-Loan-Pt-2

Welcome to the `Aave-Simple-Flash-Loan-Pt-2` repository. This repository builds upon the basic implementation of a flash loan contract for Aave v3, utilizing the Hardhat framework. While the primary goal of the original project was to provide a simple example of how flash loans work within the Aave ecosystem, this part delves into more advanced topics, including deployment scripts and deploying the FlashLoan contract on testnets, including Layer 2 solutions.

## Introduction

This repository is an extension of the [Aave-Simple-Flash-Loan repository](https://github.com/CyberAnon1010101/Blockchain-BasicFlashLoan) project, covering more advanced topics related to flash loans within the Aave ecosystem. It includes deployment scripts and instructions for deploying the FlashLoan contract on various testnets, including Layer 2 solutions.

## Verification and Security

Each modification to this project undergoes a meticulous verification process and subsequent signing. This stringent approach guarantees the authenticity and integrity of our codebase. In case you encounter any modifications that lack appropriate verification, we strongly advise against cloning or utilizing them, as they might harbor malicious code.

## Commented Code

Our codebase is meticulously documented with comprehensive comments, aimed at providing a clear understanding of the functionality of individual components.


## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To explore and interact with the Aave Flash Loan Contract and its advanced features, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

### Install Dependencies

2. Ensure you have `node.js` and `npm` installed in your environment.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Smart Contract Deployment

**We will be deploying the FlashLoan smart contract on Polygon Mumbai testnet**

To deploy the `SimpleFlashLoanPt2.sol` contract, follow these steps:

1. Set your deployment environment by forking the network you want to use for the Hardhat node. We recommend using your own RPC URL for better reliability. You can create your own Web3 API keys on the Infura website: [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)

   You can also use a public RPC URL. Visit the Chainlist website for any public URL on the network you want to use: [Chainlist](https://chainlist.org/)

2. If you use your own RPC URL, create a `.env` file and add the following:

   ```
   YOUR_API_KEY= " Paste your key here "
   YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY= " Paste your Account/Wallet private key here "
   ```

3. Command to fork Polygon Mumbai chain for your Hardhat node, using your own RPC URL:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node --fork https://polygon-mumbai.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_API_KEY}
   ```

   Command to fork Polygon Mumbai chain for your Hardhat node, using a public RPC URL:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat node --fork https://polygon-mumbai-bor.publicnode.com
   ```
   
   Get faucets MATIC for the gas fees:
   - MATIC faucets: [Mumbai Faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/)

   Get faucets USDC for the FlashLoan:
   - USDC faucets: [Aave Faucet](https://staging.aave.com/faucet/)

**Update:** More detailed deployment instructions will be provided soon.
