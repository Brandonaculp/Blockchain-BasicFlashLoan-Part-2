# Aave-Simple-Flash-Loan-Pt-2

Welcome to the `Aave-Simple-Flash-Loan-Pt-2` repository. This repository builds upon the basic implementation of a flash loan contract for Aave v3, utilizing the Hardhat framework. While the primary goal of the original project was to provide a simple example of how flash loans work within the Aave ecosystem, this part delves into more advanced topics, including deployment scripts and deploying the FlashLoan contract on testnets, including Layer 2 solutions.
